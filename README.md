# Survivops 🎮

[![CI](https://github.com/flaventu/survivops/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/flaventu/survivops/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Purpose 🥅

This is a project for the "[Fundamentals of computer graphics](https://corsi.unige.it/off.f/2024/ins/77856)" course offered by the Bachelor's degree in [Computer Science](https://corsi.unige.it/corsi/8759) at the [University of Genoa](https://unige.it/).

## Description ▶️

It is a simple low-level 2D single player game in which you can explore the world map, collect objects and use them to fight against enemies, developing your character's skills and weapons.

## Why SurvivOps ❔

The title is a play on the words "survive" and "Ops", just like [Dev-Ops](https://azure.microsoft.com/it-it/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-devops). The idea is to take the main pivots of the model, where you **build** your application, **test** it and finally **deploy** it multiple times to associate it to the functions of the game;

- 🔧 build: you can purchase or find objects (such as weapons, ecc...) and increments your player ability.
- 🧪 test: there is a training area where you can simulate fight.
- ✈️ deploy: where you can finally fight real enemies and take on new challenges as you proceed into the game.

It's a run-based game, which means that instead of following a linear story, the game substantially never ends, allowing the player great freedom in their gameplay.

## Constraint 🛑

1. the project must start from **scratch** (i can only use the [cmake-sfml-project](https://github.com/SFML/cmake-sfml-project) template).
2. I cannot use **external library** except for [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) itself.
3. I can only operate with **basic primitives** (text, simple shapes, sprite and vertex array).
